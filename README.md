# GodotSharp

This repository automatically builds the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) engine with Github Actions and publishes the built C# DLLs to [nuget.org](https://nuget.org/packages/GodotSharp) so they can be used as dependencies for other C# nuget packages.

The only versions uploaded are built from commits tagged as a release.
